# Geological_distribution_of_solid_minerals_in_Nigeria
This project analyzes the distribution of solid minerals in Nigeria and discuss how it affect different sectors of the Nation
According to the report, Nigeria has a rich mineral endowment, with over 30 solid minerals 
available. The distribution of solid minerals is not even across the 37 states in the country. 
Ogun state and Kogi state produce over 50% in quantity and 35% in value of the solid 
minerals in Nigeria. 
The Southwest, southeast and the north central region of the country generates the highest 
value of solid minerals in the country. This can be supported by the fact that Plateau state 
has the most valuable kinds of minerals in the country. 
Furthermore, the group investigates if the abundance of solid minerals is related to total 
revenue earned in Nigeria.The methodology focuses on the distribution of solid minerals in 
Nigeria.
The analysis conducted shows that there is a positive relationship between the country’s 
GDP and the amount of minerals produced. Thus, the solid mineral sector contributes 
positively to the nation’s GDP. 
Despite the richness of these resources, Nigeria has struggled to fully capitalise on its robust
mineral endowment. This can be attributed to a lack of infrastructure and investment in the 
sector, as well as corruption and mismanagement. However, the government has recently 
made attempts to restructure the sector and encourage international investment, which could
help Nigeria's solid minerals reach their full potential.
